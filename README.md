Relay Rest Presets Project
--------------------------
Demonstration of my personal project to further my skills in Node.JS, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and general best practices for coding.

Getting Started
---------------
In order to use this project you'll need a .env file with the following:
```dotenv
SIGNALWIRE_PROJECT=YOUR PROJECT ID GOES HERE
SIGNALWIRE_TOKEN= YOUR API TOKEN GOES HERE
SIGNALWIRE_SPACE=EXAMPLE.signalwire.com
```
I have included an example .env to make it even easier. All you'll need to do is enter your information in the requested areas.
